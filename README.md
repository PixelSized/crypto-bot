# Crypto-Bot
A Small Little Project to Turn a Small Online Tutorial of Displaying 2 EMAs on a Candle Graph, Into a Self-Governing Automatic Day-Trading Bot.

### Back-story
I had gotten into crypto a few weeks before i even considered this, however with this in mind i created a [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ph7UuSTDgk) for me and my friends to contribute and share out thoughts. as more people came and joined us, a topic came on about crypto bots. A few of the members were reading a python tutorial (where the base outdated code for this project came from) on how to make a python trading bot. However it wasn't all too good to be true, instead it was a small script that showed a graph with 2 EMA's displaying over the top of it. EVERY BROKER HAS THIS FEATURE, so it is now my goal, and the communities, to make a bot that day trades a coin on its own, without 3000 files to manage!
